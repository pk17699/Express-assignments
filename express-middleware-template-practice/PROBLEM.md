# Problem Statement: Create a middleware to check for valid form data and show it
### 1. Create your own custom middleware to read the request
### 2. Check if the request has 'email' and 'password' fields and they are not null
### 3. If they are valid and not null, continue and render them on a PUG based page using the templating capabilities
### 4. If they are invalid and null, send the error back saying "Incorrect Credentials"
